Spherical Gaussians are a useful tool for encoding precomputed radiance within a scene. Matt Pettineo has [an excellent series](https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/sg-series-part-1-a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-baked-lighting-representations/) describing the technical details and history behind them which I'd suggest reading before the rest of this post.

Recently, I've had need to build spherical Gaussian representations of a scene on the fly in the GPU path tracer I'm building for my Master's project. Unlike, say, spherical harmonics, spherical Gaussian lobes don't form a set of orthonormal bases; they need to be computed with a least-squares solve, which in turn requires having access to all radiance samples at once. On the GPU, in a memory-constrained environment, this is highly impractical. 

> Edit: as Peter Pike-Sloan [pointed out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PeterPikeSloan/status/1044482721223856128), this isn't exactly correct. For a least-squares solve, you can accumulate the radiance values directly and then store only the directions per-sample. If the sample directions are deterministic (e.g. can be recomputed from your sampling sequence) the only storage required is the per-lobe integral (a single colour value), although the least-squares solve is still necessary. If you don't need progressive rendering, however, that could be a valid alternative to the method I propose here.

Instead, games like The Order: 1886 just projected the samples onto the spherical Gaussian lobes [as if the lobes form an orthonormal basis](https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/sg-series-part-5-approximating-radiance-and-irradiance-with-sgs/), which gave low-quality results that lack contrast. For my research, I wanted to see if I could do better.

After a bunch of experimentation, I found a new algorithm for accumulating spherical Gaussian samples that's almost as good as a least-squares solve if the sample directions are randomly distributed, or is slightly better than a na誰ve projection if the sample directions are correlated (as they would be, say, if you were reading pixels row by row from a lat-long image map.) Conveniently, when we're accumulating samples from path tracing the sample directions are usually stratified or uniformly random.

The algorithm is as follows, and supports both non-negative and regular solves:

{% highlight swift %}
struct SphericalGaussianBasis {
    var lobes : [SphericalGaussian]
    var lobeWeights = [Float](repeating: 0.0, count: lobes.count)
    let nonNegativeSolve : Bool
    
    mutating func accumulateSample(_ sample: RadianceSample) {
        var currentValue = float3(0)
        
        var sampleLobeWeights = [Float](repeating: 0.0, count: self.lobes.count)
        for (i, lobe) in self.lobes.enumerated() {
            let dotProduct = dot(lobe.axis, sample.direction)
            let weight = exp(lobe.sharpness * (dotProduct - 1.0))
            currentValue += lobe.amplitude * weight
            
            sampleLobeWeights[i] = weight
        }
        
        let deltaValue = sample.value - currentValue
        
        for i in 0..<self.lobes.count {
            let weight = sampleLobeWeights[i]
            if weight == 0 { continue }
            
            lobeWeights[i] += weight
            
            let weightScale = weight / self.lobeWeights[i]
            self.lobes[i].amplitude += deltaValue * weightScale
            
            if (self.nonNegativeSolve) {
                self.lobes[i].amplitude = max(self.lobes[i].amplitude, float3(0))
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The basic idea is fairly simple: at each step, we evaluate the sum of the spherical Gaussian lobes in the new sample's direction. Then, we evaluate the difference between the sample's value and the current value. Finally, we adjust each lobe's amplitude towards the sample's amplitude according to its weight. If we want the lobe to be non-negative, we simply clamp it; the next sample to come in will then be evaluated against the set of non-negative lobes. I've called this a 'running average'; perhaps a better description is that is uses gradient descent to solve for the radiance.

So how does it look? Well, here are the results for the 'ennis.hdr' environment map using uniformly randomly shuffled sample directions and twelve lobes ('Running Average' is my new method):

It's a marked improvement over the na誰ve projection, and, depending on the sample distribution, can be imperceptibly different from the least squares encoding. And it all works on the fly, on the GPU, requiring only a per-lobe mean and weight to be stored.

In these images, I'm using [Stephen Hill's fitted approximation for a cosine lobe](https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/sg-series-part-3-diffuse-lighting-from-an-sg-light-source/) to evaluate the irradiance for all encoding methods. 

> Update: Matt Pettineo has integrated this new method into [The Baking Lab](https://github.com/TheRealMJP/BakingLab). If you want to take a look you can find it under the 'Running Average' and 'Running Average Non-Negative' solve modes.

As I progress on my thesis, I hope to uncover more of the reasoning behind _why_ it works so well, and I'm also hopeful it can find applications for this in other encoding schemes ([Ambient Dice](https://research.activision.com/t5/Publications/Ambient-Dice/ba-p/10284641), perhaps?)

_While testing this, I used [Probulator](https://github.com/kayru/Probulator), a useful open-source tool for testing different lighting encoding strategies. The source code for the implementation of this method within Probulator is below._

_Note that the original implementation of irradiance for the na誰ve projection in Probulator cheats a little bit, since it uses a non-cosine BRDF to evaluate the spherical Gaussian lobes. If we're also using the spherical Gaussian to encode radiance for specular lighting, compensating with the BRDF doesn't really work; we want things to be consistent._
