I'm Thomas Roughton, currently a Masters student studying computer graphics at Victoria University of Wellington.

I wrote [SwiftFrameGraph](https://github.com/troughton/SwiftFrameGraph), a (theoretically) platform independent graphics API and render graph, with [Joseph Bennett](http://josephbennett.me).
